<h1>ABOUT</h1>
<p class="pr">The Journalism & Media Academy Magnet School opened in 2013  in a new, state-of-the art facility fully equipped to provide an unparalleled opportunity for students to advance their communication skills through innovations in individualized learning.

JMA  students receive a customized curriculum in a technology-rich environment with teachers who are practicing experts in their professional fields.  Students benefit from a college-ready curriculum, infused with media literacy, and are exposed to reading and writing for various formats while learning to understand the language, power and business of the media world.

A partnership with Connecticut Public Broadcasting Network offers students a new and exciting learning environment, where core curriculum is combined with must-have understanding of the role of media across industries. Students spend their time at CPBN's spectacular satellite campus, working with industry experts to further their individual passions, and continuing to strengthen their academic development. Senior year at the Academy is essentially an intensive internship where students create professional-level media projects and a portfolio of work to present to colleges and potential employers, amid an environment infused with academic excellence.

Students develop workplace and college readiness competencies through curriculum, job shadowing and internships - and hands-on experience.</p
